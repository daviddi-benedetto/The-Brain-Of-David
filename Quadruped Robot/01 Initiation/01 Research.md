## Fundamentals
Initiating this project requires a clear focus on what defines any mechanism: an assortment of linkages. For the purpose of this project, the lower level nitty-gritty stuff is mainly kinematics.

Looking at the leg used in Spot Micro:

Each leg is essentially two linkages grounded from their top, where they connect with the body. From a higher level point of view, the body itself is a linkage, but for the purpose of a single leg there are essentially two links.

### Simplification
If we strip everything aesthetic and assume them to be two 2D bars, the form is significantly simplified. The first course of action to make my life as easy as possible is to map out the form and all associated parts as if it was a skeleton.

Each of these links can be easily laser cut for quick prototyping. Then, I can work on actuating a single leg
