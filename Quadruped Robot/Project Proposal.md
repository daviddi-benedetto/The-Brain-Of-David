### Development of Educational Build Kit: Robot Quadruped
 Student: David Di-Benedetto
 Supervisor: Scott Evans

## Introduction

### Problem Statement

The world of robotics is rapidly evolving, so much so that the idea of machines that resemble animals are fairly commonplace now in both media and academic institutions. Yet, there's a noticeable gap in the availability of resources, expertise, and documentation for creating these robots. This project delves into the possibilities offered by readily accessible and cost-effective technologies such as Arduinos and Raspberry Pi by focusing on creating a student-friendly kit that builds a robot quadruped capable of sustaining a steady, remote-controlled gait. The aim is to craft an electro-mechanical project that provides a hands-on project in engineering that is appealing to both existing and aspiring students. Utilizing user-friendly building kits to construct the basic structure of a robot quadruped, I plan to lower the entry barriers into the world of robotics, fostering an environment where learning is facilitated and personal creativity in customization is encouraged.
### Motivations

This robot project is designed to continue the tradition of inspiring innovation and creativity in the makerspace, much like my previous endeavors with instruments. Each creation, whether it be a guitar, a violin, or this robot, stands as a testament to the diverse range of ingenuity possible in technology. This robot, in particular, is envisioned as a kit that enables users to customize and interact with it, bringing a personalized experience. This approach fosters an environment of active learning and exploration that lean true to TIWâ€™s principles. The intention is not just to display technology but to invite students to engage with it deeply, to understand, modify, and be inspired by it. Each project, with its unique value, contributes to a broader culture of creativity and innovation, encouraging students to see beyond the surface and explore the depths of what they can achieve with technology.
## Accessibility

This robot project represents an innovative step forward in the makerspace's educational offerings. It's a thoughtfully designed bundle affordable enough to allow the makerspace to produce many units, which naturally facilitates widespread student engagement. Moreover, this robot kit is designed with customization in mind, encouraging students to make it truly their own. It's a starting point, providing the basic framework which students can build upon, adding sensors or other components as their skills and interests grow. This aspect of the project emphasizes creative exploration and personal innovation, allowing students to push the boundaries of what they can create and learn in the realm of robotics. It's not just about building a robot; it's about cultivating a deeper, more engaged learning experience that is both replicable and inspiring.
## Design Guidelines

The design of this robot adheres to a set of carefully considered guidelines:

* Visibility of Mechanisms

     A key aspect of the robot's design is the clear visibility of its mechanical components. This approach facilitates an understanding of the intricacies of robotic movement and function, providing educational insight.

* Modularity and Customization 

    The robot is inherently modular, allowing for easy modifications, additions, and removals of components. This feature is crucial for fostering a creative and experimental atmosphere, where students can personalize the robot to suit their individual project goals and learning objectives.

* Cost-Effectiveness

    To ensure broad accessibility and the ability to produce multiple units, cost-effectiveness is a primary consideration in the design. This focus on affordability makes the robot accessible to all students and offers the potential for them to replicate or build portions of the robot for personal exploration.

* Comprehensive Documentation

    The project includes detailed documentation, encompassing CAD files, programming code, wiring diagrams, and budget breakdowns. This extensive resource is intended to aid students in understanding, replicating, and further developing the robot, thereby enhancing their learning and development in the field of robotics.

* Interactive Design 

    The robot is conceived to be highly interactive, encouraging active engagement from students. This interaction goes beyond mere operation; it extends to how students can engage with, modify, and learn from the robot, making it a dynamic element.
## Next Steps

### Plan of Action 

The development process of this project is structured into two main phases. The first phase is focused on replicating and enhancing the open-source Spot Micro, utilizing the existing but currently incomplete documentation (available at [https://spotmicroai.readthedocs.io](https://spotmicroai.readthedocs.io)). This stage will make use of servo motors and Arduino-level electronics from existing inventory, aiming to produce a fully functional and easily replicable version of Spot Micro, alongside a comprehensive tutorial to facilitate its construction.

The second phase shifts towards the creation of a barebones skeleton build kit, designed as a foundation for student projects. This kit will serve as an adaptable framework, providing students with the basic components and structure to build their own robot quadruped. The objective is to supply a versatile starting point that encourages creativity and customization. Students will have the opportunity to add, modify, or upgrade various aspects of the robot, tailoring it to their needs. The emphasis in this phase is on facilitating a hands-on experience, where students can actively engage in the assembly and customization.
### Project Timeline
#### Project Initiation (January 16 -  January 30)
* Focus on project planning, defining low-level objectives, procuring materials, and initial research.
* Design Check 1 on January 30.
#### Single Function Leg Development (January 31 - February 21)
* Develop and test a single functioning leg for the robot, ensuring design and functionality criteria are met.
* Design Check 2 on February 21.
#### Full Robot Assembly (February 22 - March 22)
* Assemble the complete Spot Micro robot, integrating all legs and ensuring overall functionality.
* Design Check 3 on March 22.
#### Documentation Phase (March 23 - April 6)
* Write comprehensive documentation, including a tutorial for the Spot Micro robot.
* Design Check 4 on April 6
#### Kit Development and Finalization (April 7 - April 18)
* Develop the skeleton build kit, refine based on feedback, and prepare for student distribution.
* Arrange materials and resources for workshops.
* Final Design Check on April 30.
### Budget & Conclusion

For the successful execution of this project, a budget ceiling of $1,000 is proposed. While the objective is to refine and optimize the design to achieve a cost-effective build of the robot within $250, the inherent uncertainties and variables in such a project necessitate a broader financial scope. This budget allocation will accommodate essential aspects of the developmental process, including room for experimentation, unforeseen challenges, and iterative improvements. Significant progress has already been made in the initial stages of this endeavor. With this proposed budget, it will be possible to not only sustain but also effectively advance the ongoing work, ensuring the project's objectives are met with the desired quality and efficiency.
