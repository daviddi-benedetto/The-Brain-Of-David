# One At A Time
I, like many ambitious folk, find myself constantly inspired by a multitude of things at once. For the past few years of my life, I have been juggling multiple passions at any given moment with the complete belief that I can accommodate for every desire of mine with the limited time available in the day. Spoiler: I cannot. The consequence of this belief makes it such that my projects either never get finished, or they do but never up to par to the expectations I set for them. 

After further thought, I realized that it's not at the fault of my own or a criticism of by abilities as an engineer. Its a testament to the fact that *there is only so much one can do in a day*. I tried to fight this, but I'm only human. My solution is the principle of *One At a Time*.  This means only working on one passion project at any given time until there is a level of completion that I can truly say I am satisfied with.

Weirdly enough, this has been surprisingly difficult for me. I get so passionate about my work, the idea of deferring them to a later date annoys me and makes me restless. I genuinely love what I do--maybe a little too much. Thankfully, I have started making methods of making *One At a Time* easier.

- *[[Planr Overview|Planr]] - As a project of its own, I am building a digital planner that conforms to my style of lightweight project based objectives. Emphasis on lightweight.
- [[Projects Roadmap]] - Here is where I am currently planning the order of my projects.
- [[Ideas List]] - Here, I am deferring my ideas by placing them on a list to consider later.
