# Aluminum
Aluminum is widely used and is the most abundant metal on Earth and is used across most industries. The laptop I am currently writing this note in is made mostly out of aluminum!

## Alloy Choices
#### 1xxx Series - Pure Aluminum

- **Description**: The 1xxx series alloys are characterized by their high purity, with aluminum content exceeding 99%. They offer excellent corrosion resistance and are highly ductile.
- - **Example Alloy**: **1100**
	- **Applications**:
	    - Food and beverage cans
	    - Heat exchangers
	    - Kitchen utensils
	    - Architectural components
- **Pros**:
    - High purity
    - Excellent corrosion resistance
    - Highly ductile (easy fabrication)
- **Cons**:
    - Relatively low strength

#### 2xxx Series - Copper Alloys

- **Description**: The 2xxx series aluminum alloys contain copper as their primary alloying element. They are known for their high strength, good machinability, and wear resistance.
- **Example Alloy**: **2024**
	- **Applications**:
	    - Aircraft structural components
	    - Aerospace fasteners
	    - High-strength parts in aircraft and aerospace industry

	    - Heat exchangers
	    - Architectural sheet metal
	    - Automotive components**
- **Pros**:
    - Moderate strength
    - Excellent corrosion resistance
    - High formability
- **Cons**:
    - Reduced strength compared to some alloys
    - Limited heat-treatability

#### 6xxx Series - Aluminum-Silicon-Magnesium Alloys

- **Description**: The 6xxx series aluminum alloys contain silicon and magnesium as major alloying elements. They offer good formability, weldability, and moderate strength, making them versatile for various applications.
- - **Example Alloy**: **6061**
	- **Applications**:
	    - Extrusions for frames and structures
	    - Bicycle frames
	    - Automotive parts
	    - Boats and marine components
- **Pros**:
    - Good formability
    - Weldability
    - Moderate strength
- **Cons**:
    - Susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking in some conditions

#### 7xxx Series - Zinc Alloys
