# Titanium

Titanium is a mainly  known for its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and biocompatibility. Apparently it is referred to as the "space-age metal" due to its extensive use in aerospace and medical applications

## Alloy Choices

### Commercially Pure Titanium - Grade 1 to 4

- **Description**: Commercially pure titanium alloys, labeled as Grade 1 to Grade 4, contain small amounts of impurities and are known for their high corrosion resistance and excellent formability.
- **Example Alloy**: **Grade 2 (CP2 Titanium)**
    - **Applications**:
        - Medical implants (dental implants, bone screws)
        - Chemical processing equipment
        - Marine components (boat propellers)
        - Jewelry
- **Pros**:
    - Exceptional corrosion resistance
    - Lightweight
    - Biocompatible
- **Cons**:
    - Relatively low strength compared to alloyed titanium
