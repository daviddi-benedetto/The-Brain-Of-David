## Planr - Overview
Planr is an app with two purposes:
1. To streamline my focus into a planner perfectly customized for my usage
2. To strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

I like this two-birds-one-stone approach. I'm always looking for ways to increase my productivity, so this project feels like a good fit.
## Initial Ideas
The current idea is to have the app consist of four main sections
1. The header
2. TBD
3. Tasks
4. Calendar

The header will be consistent with most modern UI's, with a navigation section, logo, as well as the user menus and settings. The body of the app will consist of varying widget-styled additions that focus on creating organization from the abstract. This will likely consist of a markdown notes section (for those who want to use *Planr* as an all-in-one) as well as a task system organized by projects and a column dedicated to Google Calendar and Apple Calendar integrations.

I'm building this app with myself as the target audience, and similar to my reasoning with creating *The Brain*, I want to create functionality for the moments when I have too much going on in my head and it needs to be placed down. *The Brain* is for the notes. *Planr* is for my day-to-day tasks.
