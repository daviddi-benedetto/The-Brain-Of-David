## Files Over Apps
I've come to feel a stronger sense of ownership towards my digital presence. As I continue to learn more about modern software, I'm truly starting to understand how much of our lives are hosted on external databases and how limiting that can be.

I recently read a post by *kepano*, one of the engineers building Obsidian mentioning this idea of "Files Over Apps" where we can break this chain of dependency by making the contents inside of an app independent of the functions of the app itself. For example, with Obsidian, although this website is being hosted virtually to create a website, all the text files are physically on my computer *as well* as backed up in different clouds. This makes it such that if Obsidian were to disappear tomorrow, I would lose none of all my work, just this specific interface that I use to read the .md files.

Going forward, I plan on orienting my software towards this approach as well as transferring my current information into a format that makes my information survive independent of the well-being of any particular company or app.
